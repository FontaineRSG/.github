# 🌊 Welcome to **Fontaine Research Group**  
*Bored programmers building software that "just works" — no bloat, no drama.*  

---

## 🧪 Who Are We?  
We’re a small team of developers obsessed with **efficiency**, **elegance**, and open-source philosophy. Our mission: create tools and systems that feel *effortless* to use. Think of us as digital alchemists — turning caffeine and code into something magical.  

**Flagship Project**: [**elementOS**](https://github.com/FontaineRSG/elementOS) — A Linux-based OS inspired by the fluidity of water (and our love for clean code).

## ⚙️ How We Work  
- **Open Source First**: Everything we build is public, hackable, and community-driven.  
- **Boredom-Driven Development**: If it’s not fun to code, we’re not doing it.  
- **Minimalism Over Everything**: Less code = fewer bugs. Fight us.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer (Yes, Again)  
**We are NOT affiliated with HoYoverse, Genshin Impact, or its universe.**  
While we borrow naming inspiration from Fontaine (and Teyvat’s aesthetics), this is strictly a fan-driven, non-commercial effort.
